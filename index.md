I am the Chief Engineer at [64 Studio Ltd](http://64studio.com) where we develop software and hardware solutions for Embedded platforms, normally with an audio or multimedia focus. We have worked on some very interesting and varied developments since I started in 2010.

Most of the time I can be found in a dark room poking at the Linux Kernel trying to get an extra few bogomips of performance, crafting the final lines of an ALSA Soundcard driver, porting software to a newly released platform, laying out a circuit board or running hardware verification tests.

Currently I live in South East England with my partner. On the few days of sun we have a year, I enjoy getting away from the soldering iron and cycling around the rolling terrain.

I try to keep up-to-date with the ever-changing technology industry and investigate new platforms and single-board computers. When I feel like I've had too much digital, I restore sanity by repairing analog audio mixers, power amplifiers and turntables!

As well as being proficient in embedded software over a number of different languages I originally trained and worked as an Electronics Design Engineer so am used to debugging down to hardware-level.

Around 2008 I caught the Linux bug and have never looked back!
